# [COLOR/FORMATTING CODES]
#                          Most of the fields support color codes!
# You can use '*' as the alternative color char!
# If you see "(c/f)" in a parameter's name this means that field
# support either the color code (c), formatting code (f) or both!
# Example: "*b I'M AQUA!" Learn more at the link below:
# https://minecraft.tools/en/color-code.php
#
# [GLOBAL VARIABLES]
#                     You can use them in Strings
# (or Integers) that supports variables!
# If you see "(GV)" in a parameter's name this means that field
# supports the variables! some parameters might only support
# local variables "(LV)" but there will be a hint to what variables
# You can use inside the string/integer!
# You can get a value of a parameter from this file by requesting it
# e.g: %PATH_TO_VARIABLE% like %SERVER_NAME% or %SERVER_MOTD_LINE1%
#
# [PARAMETER TYPES]
#                   Parameter types are a good hint for you!
# You can see what type of data the parameter needs to use!
# e.g: [<greedyString> (c/f/GV)]
# This means the parameter wants a greedy string that supports
# Color/Formatting codes with global variables!
